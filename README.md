CaptainVTOL Recreation of 40I Airport in Ohio

40I airport for MSFS

Created by: CaptainVTOL

As requested by PilotEdge Discord member Broken Buzzard, I've taken a crack at recreating 40I Red Stewart Airfield in Waynesville, Ohio. 

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits I make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all I ask is to receive credit for the airport.
