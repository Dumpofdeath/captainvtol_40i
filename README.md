CaptainVTOL Recreation of 40I Airport in Ohio

40I airport for MSFS

Created by: CaptainVTOL

As requested by PilotEdge Discord member Broken Buzzard, I've taken a crack at recreating 40I Red Stewart Airfield in Waynesville, Ohio. 

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits I make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all I ask is to receive credit for the airport.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

While on the "Code" tab above, click the green "Code" button, then select Download Zip.
When the .zip file is downloaded, extract it somewhere on your computer. You should end up with a folder titled "captainvtol_mko-master".
Inside the master folder is another folder titled "captainvtol-mko". Drag this folder into your MSFS\Community directory.
That's it! Fire up MSFS, then go to World Map and search for MKO.
